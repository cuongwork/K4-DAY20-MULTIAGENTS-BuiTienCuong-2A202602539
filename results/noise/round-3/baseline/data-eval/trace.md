### Human
Analyse the order events in `workspace/orders.json` (see `workspace/README.md` for the field descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `march_revenue_utc` (number): sum of `total` of the orders placed in March 2024, where the month is determined in **UTC**.
- `march_orders_utc` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `march_revenue_utc`.
- `top_category` (string): the category with the highest total revenue over the whole file (lowercase name).
- `missing_total_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose total is missing.
- `duplicate_events_removed` (integer): number of duplicate events you removed.

Orders with a missing total must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.

# orders.json - data dictionary

A JSON array of order events.

| field | description |
|---|---|
| id | order identifier. An event may be delivered more than once; keep the first event of each id. |
| placed_at | ISO-8601 timestamp with a UTC offset (`Z`, `+07:00`, `-05:00`, ...). |
| category | product category. Spelling, capitalisation and surrounding spaces are not consistent. |
| total | order total in USD, as a number or as a string such as `"1,250.00"`. The value `-1` means the total is unknown (missing). |

### Assistant
I cleaned the data by removing duplicate order events based on the order ID, keeping only the first occurrence of each order. I normalized the category names by stripping spaces and converting to lowercase. I converted the total field to a float, handling both string and numeric formats, and excluded orders with a missing total (-1) from revenue calculations. I converted the placed_at timestamps to UTC to correctly identify orders placed in March 2024 UTC. The final report includes the total revenue and count of orders placed in March 2024 UTC, the top revenue category overall, the count of orders with missing totals, and the count of duplicate events removed. The results are saved in workspace/answer.json.
