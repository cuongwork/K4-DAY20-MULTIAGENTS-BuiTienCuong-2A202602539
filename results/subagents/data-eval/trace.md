### Human
Analyse the order events in `workspace/orders.json` (see `workspace/README.md` for the field descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `march_revenue_utc` (number): sum of `total` of the orders placed in March 2024, where the month is determined in **UTC**.
- `march_orders_utc` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `march_revenue_utc`.
- `top_category` (string): the category with the highest total revenue over the whole file (lowercase name).
- `missing_total_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose total is missing.
- `duplicate_events_removed` (integer): number of duplicate events you removed.

Orders with a missing total must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.

# orders.json - data dictionary

A JSON array of order events.

| field | description |
|---|---|
| id | order identifier. An event may be delivered more than once; keep the first event of each id. |
| placed_at | ISO-8601 timestamp with a UTC offset (`Z`, `+07:00`, `-05:00`, ...). |
| category | product category. Spelling, capitalisation and surrounding spaces are not consistent. |
| total | order total in USD, as a number or as a string such as `"1,250.00"`. The value `-1` means the total is unknown (missing). |

### Tool result
Updated file /workspace/answer.json

### Assistant
I cleaned the data by removing duplicate events based on the order id, keeping only the first occurrence of each id. I normalized the category names by trimming spaces and converting to lowercase for consistent aggregation. I excluded orders with a missing total (-1) from revenue calculations. I calculated March 2024 revenue and order count using the UTC month from the placed_at timestamp. The top category was determined by the highest total revenue across all orders. The final results are saved in workspace/answer.json.
